<h1>The Best Movies According to Or'el</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>I love the plot, the actors are excellent and the period of the film is simple and romantic, like nothing else.</p>
<h3>Populaire</h3>
<p>A charming French film, the period when women begin to work, the role of a secretary is considered the highlight. And the actors, how can we not mention the quality of their acting and chemistry?</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>How can you not love this movie?</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime.</p>
<h3>All 3 of Bridget Jones Movies</h3>
<p>Ren√©e Kathleen Zellweger is a very good actress. Beautiful movie.<br />I'm waiting for the 4th Movie that will come out in 2025.</p>
